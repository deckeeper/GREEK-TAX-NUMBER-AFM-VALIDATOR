# GREEK-TAX-NUMBER-AFM-VALIDATOR
This i a simple GUI to check if a given a number is a valid greek TAX-NUMBER(AFM).

The algorithm that makes the validation is written in javascript.


PAY ATTENTION! 

This checks only if a given TAX-NUMBER can be valid , not if it actually exits.

For the styling of the page i used the sakura css framework (https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura).
